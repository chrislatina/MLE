* Potentiometer Knob 1 controls the inter-onset interval ranging between 4 and 400 milliseconds.
* Potentiometer Knob 2 controls the onset threshold (spec-tral flux level) ranging between 0 and 8.0
* Potentiometer Knob 3 controls the maximum FFT bin to ana- lyze (a high pass filter for feature detection).
* Potentiometer Knob 4 controls the minimum FFT bin to analyze (a low pass filter for feature detection).
* Potentiometer Knob 5 controls the volume of the feature audio sonification output.
* Potentiometer Knob 6 controls the volume of the dry audio throughput.
